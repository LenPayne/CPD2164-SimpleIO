# I/O Sample for iPhone

This project is a sample for CPD2164 Intro to Mobile Development.

The project implements a single-page iPhone app that includes a label and a text field.

When changes are made to the text field, updates are reflected in the label.

This is, honestly, the simplest it gets with GUI iPhone work. And most of this syntax is beyond where we have covered. But you can see that it works, and what does what.
